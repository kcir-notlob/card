REM This is where the examples are (we need to build them first with ant)
REM C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\Java Card Development Kit Simulator 3.1.0\samples\classic_applets

REM WE MUST CHANGE TO THE SAMPLE DIRECTORY WITH THE build.xml IN IT FIRST


REM TO BUILD SAMPLE CHANGE TO THE SAMPLES DIRECTORY FIRST
REM EXAMPLE FOR THE WALLET EXAMPE
REM CD C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\Java Card Development Kit Simulator 3.1.0\samples\classic_applets\Wallet\applet
REM THEN USE ant


REM DON'T FORGET TO RUN THE EMULATOR IN ANOTHER SHELL OR THE BUILD WILL FAIL
REM C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\Java Card Development Kit Simulator 3.1.0\bin>cref

start cref
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle\Java Card Development Kit Simulator 3.1.0\samples\classic_applets\Wallet\applet"
